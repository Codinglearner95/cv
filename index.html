  <h1>ðŸ¤¡BRIANS FACTSðŸ¤¡</h1>
  <p><sub>I'M</sub> MAN <sub>SO</sub> I'M <sub>RIGHT</sub>, <strong>IT'S NATURE LISTEN CLOSE FUCKERS.</strong></p>
  <p>First and Foremost according to the farmers almanac drinking your own urine has many benefits. If we take a look inside the cheetahs vagina we find that it's nature just like the engine in a car.  Furthermore the reminents of oil which comes from plant's fecies which is how carbon 12 & 13 are created. Just look at the water tables for more information on that, but dont forget I'm man and man is always right.  When we look further into the diagnosis we find I might have slight downsyndrome attributes but the doctors diagnosis is just a hypothesis so what does he really know? After all I'm man and you know what that means. When you look at the data you will find gmo which stands for <em>genetically modified orangutans</em>. It's nature. Smoking cigs can increase you life expectancy times 10. Looking back to the farmer almanac we can see that the isotopes of water tell us it comes from the earth and is never ending.  That being said its time for another shot of scotch.</p>

  <p>The earth is flatt and we all know this just by studying the nature of hobbits from the lord of rings. Everyone has a lazy eye mines just a little worse than most but that doesnt stop me from being right!  We all know second hand smoke is a myth and its actually benefits you.If you have a derpy lip dont speak to me.  I once won a debate against Baconrules21 it was the highlight of my life of course he wasnt going to win because im man and <sub>its</sub> fucking <sub>NATURE</sub></p>
<h3>Science is a myth because its not nature</h3>
<p>As we take a look at the <strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism">genetically modified orangutans</a></strong> we see what science tells us is a myth! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnH1wek9SvM">WOW!</a> shocker right? It muss be a glitch?! Wrong because I am man and man is always right. You see when you boil gas/oil we undstand the hypothesis of where babies come from. IT fucking nature losers!  We've been smoking plants for thousands of years! It's all starting to make sense! But be careful when you figure it all out is when you die.</p>
